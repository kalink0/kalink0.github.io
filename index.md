# Ressource and Tool Overview

I decided to move my current list of tools and knowledge ressources to github. And at the same moment I thought it could be a good idea to just put it online as a git page, so it is easy to browse for me from anywhere.
The tools and ressources will have to to with the topics Digital Forensics, Incident Response and IT Sec stuff in general. Perhaps also IT stuff in general

So, if you read this - welcome. Feel free to use my listed ressources and tools. But: I don't own them and I am not related to them, you need to take care of licensing stuff etc., I just link and mention them. Kudos to the owners.

PS: There are many lists like this out there in the wild, maintained by a lot of great persons. My list just reflects my current knowledge and set of tools.
